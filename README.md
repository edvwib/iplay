This is a replacement landing page for the app Iplay Sport

([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/iplay-sport/id1068927526?l=en&mt=8 "Iplay Sport on the App Store"),  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iplay "Iplay Sport on Google Play"))

**The goals for the new landing page were mainly:**

-   Call to action: Get users to download the app
-   Take inspiration from the app
-   Mobile first, 80% of users on the current site use a smartphone
-   Make is simple to add more/new content to the site, as needed
-   Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
-   Maximize the amount of app downloads

The page has to be built with WordPress, for easy management and updating of content.

**Installation/Usage:**  
_**Note:**  In order to use this theme fully, the WordPress plugin "Advanced Custom Fields  **Pro**  is required"_

Tools needed: 
* npm
* php-cli
* composer

1. Clone this repository to your computer, and navigate into it with your favorite terminal and execute two commands: `composer install` & `npm install`. This may take a while.
2. To compile the SCSS and JavaScript run the command `npm run prod`, or if your looking to develop this further, run the command `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` to continuously check for changes in the source files and automatically compile. 
3. Now your ready to launch the website, for testing purposes I recommend the command line tool for PHP and starting it by executing `php -S localhost:8080 -t public` from the root folder of the repository. You can now visit the site in the browser at localhost:8080.
